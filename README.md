# task_cruncher
A feature-rich TODO-list in a single html-file. It will run in a browser window using "local storage" for data persistence.

## Getting Started

Just copy the file <b>task_cruncher.html</b> to your local disk. Just one file, nothing more.  
Then start a browser and open the file. (Don't forget to bookmark it. You will yse it alot)

### Prerequisites

A browser that can handle "local storage". Chrome and Mozilla works well, while IE and Edge doesn't.
And you need an Internet connection as well. Because the html-page is using well-known javascript libraries which are downloaded from CDNs.

* [Bootstrap.js](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
